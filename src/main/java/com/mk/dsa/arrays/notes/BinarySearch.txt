Binary Search Algorithm - As part of Divide and conquers

Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Conditions to apply binary search:
--> The data structure should be sorted.
--> Should be able to access data at constant time

Binary Search can be implemented in two ways:

--> Iterative Binary search algorithm
--> Recursive Binary search algorithm

Has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
